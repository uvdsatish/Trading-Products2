Let’s put the answer\\nin the context of future Fed policy. If the aforementioned expectation for a 5% Fed Funds terminal rate does come to fruition, Treasury\\nyields will more than likely continue to rise, especially along the front end of the curve, as yields need to adjust to this potential higher\\nFed Funds Rate.\\nFor investors, these higher Treasury yields, both currently and potentially even higher in 2023, are creating a scenario in fixed income\\nthat investors have not been presented with in one-and-a-half decades. As a result, opportunity could be knocking on the door for\\nbond investors in 2023.\\nWhile our base case is for the Fed to continue to raise rates in the first half of 2023, around the end of second quarter, we expect the\\nFed to pause which could lead to a modest rally in rates along with a steeper curve. Rate volatility will remain elevated; however, we\\nbelieve we will not experience the rise that we witnessed this year.\\nAs discussed, income is back in Fixed Income. We favor corporate issuers combining strong fundamentals and resilient balance\\nsheets with debt seeking to offer attractive income. Selectivity remains key for investors, as the slowing in the economy will create a\\ndifferentiated set of opportunities.\\nWe also believe with the rise in rates and mortgage borrowing rates, opportunities will develop to increase exposure in mortgage-\\nbacked securities sometime this year.

Quality, value and dividends should remain important for equity investors, while bond investors, though facing\\nincreased volatility, may find themselves in a more “normal” fixed income environment—one in which they may be able to or have the\\npotential to generate an acceptable level of income for the risk they are willing to take.\\nAs we potentially enter a new market regime marked by rising rates, unstable commodity prices and increased volatility, investors should\\nconsider incorporating real assets and alternatives into their portfolios for both diversification and potential return purposes.\\nThe current market environment is one of uncertainty and mixed signals—a trend we believe will continue well into 2023. We believe\\na recession is on the nearer-term horizon, though we do believe inflation has peaked and will trend downward through next year.\\nThe Fed publicly states it remains firm in its policy to aggressively curb inflation, but we believe the primary “story” for 2023 will be\\nrecession, not inflation. And not just in the U.S.—we believe we are headed toward a global economic slowdown.\\nIn a terrible year for both stocks and bonds, some things have stood out. After years (maybe even a decade or more) of being “in the\\nwilderness,” factors such as value, dividends, size and quality have generally performed much better on a relative basis.

Beta: A measure of the volatility of a security or a portfolio in comparison to a benchmark. In general, a beta of less\\nthan 1 indicates that the investment is less volatile than the benchmark, while a beta of more than 1 indicates that the investment is more volatile than the\\nbenchmark. Bull market: A market in which share prices are rising, encouraging buying. Commodity: A raw material or primary agricultural product that can\\nbe bought and sold. Earnings growth: The annual compound annual growth rate of earnings from investments.

Gross domestic product (GDP): The\\ntotal monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific period. Growth stocks: Stocks whose\\nshare prices are higher relative to their earnings per share or dividends per share. Investors are willing to pay more because of their earnings or dividend growth\\nexpectations going forward. Inflation: Characterized by rising price levels. Market capitalization: Market cap = share prices x number of shares outstanding.\\nFirms with the highest values receive the highest weights in approaches designed to weight firms by market cap. Maturity: The amount of time until a loan\\nis repaid. Monetary policy: Actions of a central bank or other regulatory committee that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply, which\\nin turn affects interest rates. Operating earnings: The profit earned after subtracting from revenues only those expenses that are directly associated with\\noperating the business. Price-to-earnings (P/E ratio): The ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings\\n(EPS). Quality: Characterized by higher efficiency and profitability. Typical measures include earnings, return on equity, return on assets and operating\\nprofitability. This term is also related to the quality factor, which associates these stock characteristics with excess returns versus the market over time. Real\\neffective exchange rate (REER): The weighted average of a country’s currency relative to an index or basket of other major currencies, adjusted for the effects\\nof inflation. Recession: Two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, generally characterized by a slowing economy and higher unemployment. Return\\non assets (ROA): Firm profits (after accounting for all expenses) divided by the firm’s total assets. Higher numbers indicate greater profits relative to the level\\nof assets utilized to generate them. Return on equity (ROE): Measures a corporation’s profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with\\nthe money shareholders have invested. Size capitalization: A measure by which a company’s size is classified. Large caps are usually classified as companies\\nthat have a market cap of more than $10 billion.

It measures the number of people who are jobless but actively seeking employment. U-6 partial\\nemployment level: The percentage of workers who are involuntarily working at less than full employment. Value: Characterized by lower price levels relative to\\nfundamentals, such as earnings or dividends. Prices are lower because investors are less certain of the performance of these fundamentals in the future. This\\nterm is also related to the value factor, which associates these stock characteristics with excess returns versus the market over time. Yield: The income return\\non an investment. Refers to the interest or dividends received from a security that is typically expressed annually as a percentage of the market or face value.\\nZero interest rate policy (ZIRP): A monetary policy whereby interest rates, such as Fed Funds, are kept close to or at zero.\\nIndex Definitions:\\nBloomberg Aggregate Bond Index: A broad-based fixed-income index used by bond traders and the managers of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds\\n(ETFs) as a benchmark to measure their relative performance.

Investors\\nshould read the prospectus carefully before investing.\\nThere are risks associated with investing, including the possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency\\nfluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Investments in emerging or offshore markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in\\ndeveloped markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. Funds\\nfocusing their investments on certain sectors and/or regions and/or smaller companies increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory\\ndevelopment. This may result in greater share price volatility.\\nFixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. High-yield or “junk” bonds have lower credit\\nratings and involve a greater risk to principal. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest\\nand principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.\\nYou cannot invest directly in an index.

      "(7, 'WisdomTree 2023 ECONOMIC & MARKET OUTLOOK 7 INFLATION EXPECTATIONS In our opinion, inflation here in the U.S. has more than likely reached its zenith and is poised to continue to decelerate in 2023. The shift in demand from the goods side of the ledger to services has become increasingly apparent. According to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, commodities less food and energy commodities have seen its annualized rate of increase plummet over the last nine months, falling from +12.3% to +3.7% in November. We expect this trend to be sustained in the year ahead as the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown continue to recede into the past. While getting inflation back down toward the Fed’s “2% threshold” may remain elusive due to the service sector, the aforementioned shift in demand is expected to reduce overall price pressures in 2023.

One source of concern from the U.S. consumer outlook has been the fact that wage growth has not kept pace with the rise in inflation.

Incredibly, the “Volcker-esque” increase in Fed Funds this year has resulted in the Fed Funds target range going from a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) as recently as March to 4.50% in December, a total of 425 basis points (bps) in rate hikes.

In terms of the eagerly awaited “Powell Pivot,” we have always been of the opinion that it was never about 50- or 75-bp rate hikes. Instead, what truly matters is where the terminal rate is going and how long it will stay there. Monetary policy acts with a lag, and the Fed appears to be now taking this “officially” into account in its decision-making process. As of this writing, a reasonable case scenario has the voting members taking the Fed Funds trading range up to 4.75%–5% before hitting the pause button. The next unknown will be whether the Fed goes into “raise and hold” mode in 2023 or entertains rate cuts during the second half of next year. Based on recent Fed speak, at the present time, there seems to be a consensus not to reverse course too soon, but as we’ve seen, things can change quickly. 1 Refers to the years that Paul Volcker Jr., an American economist, served as the 12th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987. During his tenure as chairman, Volcker was widely credited with having ended the high levels of inflation seen in the United States throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.

The fourth quarter marked the fifth in a row in which banks’ total loan books witnessed a tightening in the Fed’s Senior Loan Officers Survey, to a net 31.3%. That reading matches levels seen in 2001, 2007 and 2020, each of which witnessed a fall in S&P 500 earnings thereafter (figure 12). Should a broad market earnings decline come to pass in 2023, that would pose a sharp contrast to the current Street consensus estimate, which sees Index-level operating earnings growing from $201.45 in 2022 to $228.61 next year, a 13.5% boost.2 Figure 12: Tightening Bank Lending Standards Bodes Poorly for S&P 500 Profits 50% -100% 40% -80% 2021: Very Few Banks S&P 500 Earnings Growth 30% Tightening Credit -60% (FY1, Left Scale) Standards 20% -40% 10% -20% 0% 0% -10% 20% -20% 2022: Many Banks 40% 31.3% Tightening Credit -30% Net % U.S. Banks Tightening Standards, Standards 60% All Loans (Inverted, Right Scale) -40% 80% -50% 100% 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 Source: Refinitiv, with the S&P 500 as of Q3/2022 and the Federal Reserve Senior Loan Officer Survey, Q4/2022.

As these negative earners encounter what we believe to be a choppier market than the one witnessed from 2009–2021, the market will need to confront a potential rotation to small-cap leadership in the 2020s. Over the 15 years to the end of the bull market, the top decile of stocks by market capitalization outperformed the bottom decile by five percentage points per year, a feat only surpassed by the 1984–1999 window that ended with the dot-com blowup. We expect figure 16 to mean revert, but it’s important to avoid land mines inside small caps. An Index such as the Russell 2000 has 26% of its market capitalization in companies with negative earnings, a far greater proportion than the S&P 500 or the Russell 1000. The small-cap rotation, should it come to pass, may leave many unprofitable firms behind.

However, there’s significant inefficiency in the market’s pricing of China risk; overreactions to both good and bad news are common.

At this juncture, due to the unknown path of the reopening process and the fact that China’s political calendar starts around March, it is premature to put too much conviction behind the Street’s tepid economic forecasts.

This development has created an interesting phenomenon: there’s “income back in fixed income.” The recent rise in U.S. Treasury (UST) rates has brought yields to levels not seen since 2007–2008, or a period spanning roughly 15 years. In other words, there is a whole generation of investors who have never experienced UST yields at these elevated levels.

      "(14, 'WisdomTree 2023 ECONOMIC & MARKET OUTLOOK 14 The natural question becomes: is there more to come? In other words, can UST yields continue rising from here? Let’s put the answer in the context of future Fed policy. If the aforementioned expectation for a 5% Fed Funds terminal rate does come to fruition, Treasury yields will more than likely continue to rise, especially along the front end of the curve, as yields need to adjust to this potential higher Fed Funds Rate. For investors, these higher Treasury yields, both currently and potentially even higher in 2023, are creating a scenario in fixed income that investors have not been presented with in one-and-a-half decades. As a result, opportunity could be knocking on the door for bond investors in 2023. While our base case is for the Fed to continue to raise rates in the first half of 2023, around the end of second quarter, we expect the Fed to pause which could lead to a modest rally in rates along with a steeper curve. Rate volatility will remain elevated; however, we believe we will not experience the rise that we witnessed this year. As discussed, income is back in Fixed Income. We favor corporate issuers combining strong fundamentals and resilient balance sheets with debt seeking to offer attractive income. Selectivity remains key for investors, as the slowing in the economy will create a differentiated set of opportunities. We also believe with the rise in rates and mortgage borrowing rates, opportunities will develop to increase exposure in mortgagebacked securities sometime this year. Wide mortgage spreads and positive convexity, a phenomenon that hasn’t been seen in a while in agency MBS, hint at potential value, but the lack of potential institutional buyers and the threat of MBS sales from the Fed’s balance sheet remain risks to this view. The outlook for emerging market debt hinges on the magnitude of any global recession that emerges. If the landing is soft, valuations in currencies, local debt, and USD corporates provide attractive opportunities. But movement towards a hard landing provides a more substantial headwind.

      "(15, 'WisdomTree 2023 ECONOMIC & MARKET OUTLOOK 15 THE DOLLAR The rapid pace of Fed tightening this year injected carry back into USD-assets (particularly relative to other Developed Market assets). Bonds suffered near-term pain in the transition to higher rates, but the US Dollar rode the Fed rate hikes to one of best years in recent memory. Unfortunately, it has also pushed the Dollar, which started 2022 as expensive to extreme valuation levels. Carry will likely continue to be supportive, but it is unlikely to the driver that it was for 2022. The Fed is on pace to continue raising rates, but the chance for the eventual rate level to be 400bp higher than one-year ahead market forecasts is very unlikely to say the least. In fact, the outlier risk of a 400bp drop in the Fed Funds rate on a hard landing would be assigned greater odds. In the last month, momentum has also faded and started to turn negative. In 2023, valuation levels could prove a challenging obstacle without carry surprises to offset and the tailwind of momentum to support them. But the world is still a tenuous place, with abundant geopolitical and economic risks, and it is hard to see the surge in global growth and risk-on appetite that would a trigger a large unwinding of the Dollar’s valuation premium in the near-term. While not our base case, a sharp reversal in Federal Reserve policy amid a hard landing for the domestic economy could turn carry into a negative driver and lead the Dollar lower. Thus, a more lackluster showing by the Dollar is likely for 2023 when compared to 2022, but the expectations of a sharp reversal could be disappointed.

SUMMARY AND ASSET ALLOCATION IMPLICATIONS Summary: We believe we are headed into recession (again) at some point in 2023. It is too early to tell if it will be a “hard” or “soft” landing with respect to the slowdown in economic growth, but history suggests that “soft landings” are few and far between. Investment Implications: We may see much more volatility and market disruptions as consumers and investors adjust to a new economic environment. Quality, value and dividends should remain important for equity investors, while bond investors, though facing increased volatility, may find themselves in a more “normal” fixed income environment—one in which they may be able to or have the potential to generate an acceptable level of income for the risk they are willing to take. As we potentially enter a new market regime marked by rising rates, unstable commodity prices and increased volatility, investors should consider incorporating real assets and alternatives into their portfolios for both diversification and potential return purposes. The current market environment is one of uncertainty and mixed signals—a trend we believe will continue well into 2023. We believe a recession is on the nearer-term horizon, though we do believe inflation has peaked and will trend downward through next year. The Fed publicly states it remains firm in its policy to aggressively curb inflation, but we believe the primary “story” for 2023 will be recession, not inflation. And not just in the U.S.—we believe we are headed toward a global economic slowdown. In a terrible year for both stocks and bonds, some things have stood out. After years (maybe even a decade or more) of being “in the wilderness,” factors such as value, dividends, size and quality have generally performed much better on a relative basis. We believe this trend will continue throughout 2023, especially in light of increasing economic uncertainty. WisdomTree.com 866.909.9473')\n",

To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.9473, or visit WisdomTree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing. There are risks associated with investing, including the possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Investments in emerging or offshore markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors and/or regions and/or smaller companies increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. High-yield or “junk” bonds have lower credit ratings and involve a greater risk to principal. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. You cannot invest directly in an index.

      "page_content='WisdomTree 2023 ECONOMIC & MARKET OUTLOOK 7 INFLATION EXPECTATIONS In our opinion, inflation here in the U.S. has more than likely reached its zenith and is poised to continue to decelerate in 2023. The shift in demand from the goods side of the ledger to services has become increasingly apparent. According to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, commodities less food and energy commodities have seen its annualized rate of increase plummet over the last nine months, falling from +12.3% to +3.7% in November. We expect this trend to be sustained in the year ahead as the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown continue to recede into the past. While getting inflation back down toward the Fed’s “2% threshold” may remain elusive due to the service sector, the aforementioned shift in demand is expected to reduce overall price pressures in 2023.

In terms of the eagerly awaited “Powell Pivot,” we have always been of the opinion that it was never about 50- or 75-bp rate hikes. Instead, what truly matters is where the terminal rate is going and how long it will stay there. Monetary policy acts with a lag, and the Fed appears to be now taking this “officially” into account in its decision-making process. As of this writing, a reasonable case scenario has the voting members taking the Fed Funds trading range up to 4.75%–5% before hitting the pause button.

Based on recent Fed speak, at the present time, there seems to be a consensus not to reverse course too soon, but as we’ve seen, things can change quickly. 1 Refers to the years that Paul Volcker Jr., an American economist, served as the 12th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987. During his tenure as chairman, Volcker was widely credited with having ended the high levels of inflation seen in the United States throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 0.79% over the last decade; inside it, companies that were unable to turn a profit posted annualized losses of 5.76%. If S&P 500 earnings disappoint in 2023, as we anticipate, we are hard-pressed to see expensive stocks and those with negative earnings presenting themselves as a haven.

      "page_content='WisdomTree 2023 ECONOMIC & MARKET OUTLOOK 14 The natural question becomes: is there more to come? In other words, can UST yields continue rising from here? Let’s put the answer in the context of future Fed policy. If the aforementioned expectation for a 5% Fed Funds terminal rate does come to fruition, Treasury yields will more than likely continue to rise, especially along the front end of the curve, as yields need to adjust to this potential higher Fed Funds Rate. For investors, these higher Treasury yields, both currently and potentially even higher in 2023, are creating a scenario in fixed income that investors have not been presented with in one-and-a-half decades. As a result, opportunity could be knocking on the door for bond investors in 2023. While our base case is for the Fed to continue to raise rates in the first half of 2023, around the end of second quarter, we expect the Fed to pause which could lead to a modest rally in rates along with a steeper curve' metadata={'page_number': 14, 'chunk': 0, 'source': 'p14-0', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'creation_date': \"D:20221214121303-05'00'\"}\n",

We also believe with the rise in rates and mortgage borrowing rates, opportunities will develop to increase exposure in mortgagebacked securities sometime this year. Wide mortgage spreads and positive convexity, a phenomenon that hasn’t been seen in a while in agency MBS, hint at potential value, but the lack of potential institutional buyers and the threat of MBS sales from the Fed’s balance sheet remain risks to this view.

Unfortunately, it has also pushed the Dollar, which started 2022 as expensive to extreme valuation levels.

The shift in demand from the goods side of the ledger to services has become increasingly apparent. According to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, commodities less food and energy commodities have seen its annualized rate of increase plummet over the last nine months, falling from +12.3% to +3.7% in November. We expect this trend to be sustained in the year ahead as the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown continue to recede into the past. While getting inflation back down toward the Fed’s “2% threshold” may remain elusive due to the service sector, the aforementioned shift in demand is expected to reduce overall price pressures in 2023.

Instead, what truly matters is where the terminal rate is going and how long it will stay there. Monetary policy acts with a lag, and the Fed appears to be now taking this “officially” into account in its decision-making process.

Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.
